**About the expert:** Ivan Dubinenkov, CEO and founder of FORSAL, scientist and chemist, Doctor of Science (Ph.D) (University of Bremen and Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany), participant of scientific expeditions in the Arctic, studied climate change.

Not so long ago, washing took the hostesses the whole weekend, pots were used for boiling, hair was rinsed with vinegar, and laundry soap was used for all cosmetic and household purposes. Today, most household tasks are automated, robot vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers and dryers work in houses, and in lockers we have about a dozen tools that allow us to fix a wide variety of problems in minutes and not be distracted by everyday issues. Smart technologies, attention to one's own health, care for the environment and other trends are changing our consciousness, lifestyle and consumption habits. Current geopolitical changes and economic sanctions are also affecting production and are instantly reflected on store shelves. In 20 years we will live in a completely different world of things, in other houses and apartments.

## Three key trends in the market of cosmetics and household chemicals

The development of the household chemicals and cosmetics industry is influenced by many factors with different effects, nature of origin and scale. However, the following trends will have a key impact on consumers, manufacturers and the product itself in the next 10-20 years.

## Sustainable development

The first thing that affects today and will only increase its impact on the household chemicals and cosmetics market is the trend towards sustainable development and compliance with the principles of ESG. According to UN [forecasts](https://www.un.org/ru/un75/shifting-demographics), by 2050 the world's population will exceed 9.8 billion people, and environmental problems will become catastrophic. Already today, manufacturers of household chemicals and cosmetics are actively "greening" production and focus on the production of products that are completely safe for health and nature, consisting only of plant components.

The demand for eco-products is also steadily growing: consumers focus on health and care for nature. In 2021, Russians [began](https://docplayer.com/219047326-Potrebitelskiy-sektor-rossii-issledovatelskiy-centr-kompanii-deloyt-v-sng-moskva-2021-god.html) to spend 30% more on environmentally friendly products, more than half of consumers (57%) pay attention to the environmental characteristics of products. An [increasing number](https://www.pwc.ru/ru/retail-consumer/publications/gcis-2021-ru.pdf) of consumers are choosing products from companies that are environmentally responsible and are choosing products with sustainable or minimal packaging (39% in 2021).

In response to market demands, more and more Russian manufacturers include fully biodegradable products in their product line, minimize the use of plastic in packaging or even completely abandon it, develop super concentrates, and develop networks of refill stations. The criteria for environmental friendliness of products and production, which will be strengthened, are as follows:

- biodegradable raw materials, preferably of vegetable or biotechnological origin, from renewable sources;
- safety for humans and nature: non-toxic, no bioaccumulation;
- waste-free and energy-efficient production, packaging from recycled and recyclable materials;
- ethical production practices and work with personnel, support for local manufacturers.

An important marker for the introduction of eco-practices in production is the availability of eco-labels and relevant certificates for products. Consumers pay attention to them. For example, in FORSAL, all our products have a certificate of conformity with environmental safety, and in the near future we are preparing production for certification according to the Life Leaf system.

## Transparency of compositions

The second factor that determines the vector of market development is the transparency of the compositions. In cosmetics, manufacturers indicate the components used according to the INCI system, there are legal requirements that oblige to provide detailed information about the components. There are no such requirements in household chemicals. Now the current practice in the industry is that manufacturers publish brief information about groups of substances and generalized statements on the labels. But for consumers, such information is no longer enough to assess the impact of funds on health and the environment: it is important for them to understand which substances interact with clothing and dishes, etc. Therefore, I am sure that, following the demand of consumers, household chemicals will soon become “transparent” as well.

We did not wait for the adoption of legislative acts and were the first in Russia to begin to fully disclose the composition of household chemicals. Today, buyers of Cleeny products can familiarize themselves with and learn about the purpose of certain components in the product. Also on the basis of "open lines" we plan to provide such data in instant messengers or social networks. In the future, we will add an allergenicity index, details on preservatives and will provide detailed information on biodegradability. We think other manufacturers will join in the near future too.

## Niche products

And the third trend that determines the prospects for the development of the industry is interest in new niche products. Manufacturers of cosmetics and household chemicals are increasingly studying their target audience, its pains, needs, consumption habits. To do this, they segment the market into smaller segments with similar specific needs, develop offers for narrower customer groups and offer the market new niche products.

The areas that will be actively explored in the coming years are the development of a line of super-concentrated products, the development of products for narrow categories of goods (for the care of sneakers, for technological materials), universal products for everything at once, like "20 in 1", and others.

In the near future, the disruption of supply chains associated with the geopolitical situation will also have a strong impact on Russian manufacturers of cosmetics and household chemicals. Due to sanctions, many manufacturers will be forced to opt for simpler, cheaper and more affordable components, to replace products from the EU and the US with products from China and other Asian countries.

## Five new formats for the consumption of household chemicals and cosmetics

Many products of the future can already be tried, but so far they have not found wide distribution. Some will be borrowed from other industries. And only a small part of what will come into use in the coming decades will have to be invented. Here are five solutions in the field of household chemicals and cosmetics that, in my opinion, will enter our lives in 15-20 years.

## Tools with personalization

Skin care routine will change significantly: it will turn into personalized care designed directly for our skin. Creams will be made based on an express analysis of the condition of the skin, information about our allergies and other restrictions. The composition of the cream will be formed "on the fly" for a person, by mixing in a special apparatus. I think it will be a home cream machine like Nespresso, only in capsules there will be active ingredients for skin care. The first such products have already appeared: already now you can get a personalized [cream](https://noie.com/) , order a personalized shampoo or [conditioner](https://www.functionofbeauty.com/product/shampoo-conditioner/) for yourself , there is an [example](https://curology.com/) projects with skin analysis to solve specific problems. Among such solutions are Function of Beauty and Curology from the USA and the Russian project Openface. Other care products and household chemicals are also subject to personalization.

## Masterbatches

Already today, concentrates are in use, which, when diluted, create a working fluid 10 or even 20 times more than the original material. Examples include dry concentrates from Blueland or eco-friendly concentrates in soluble capsules from OceanSaver. Minimizing the use of plastic, optimizing storage areas will increase the demand for masterbatches. This trend will continue to develop. Also, powders, gels, capsules will be replaced by new formats: cartridge systems with concentrated products, integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) and automatic reorders, cleaning stickers and other solutions.

## Household chemicals and cosmetics by subscription

Subscribing to music, English lessons, flower bouquets have already become a habit for many. This consumption model allows you to significantly save time on the selection, payment for goods and communications for placing an order. Very soon we will start issuing subscriptions to a basket of household chemicals and cosmetics. Such mechanics will be implemented on the basis of a detailed understanding by companies of their consumer and their consumption habits. This is especially applicable for household chemicals and cosmetics with a large and easily predictable demand: toothpaste, basic care, laundry, dishwashing detergents. Technology will also become smarter and learn how to use a subscription: for example, a dishwasher, based on actual consumption, will itself determine the date of purchase of a new batch and create an order for the next package of eco-friendly tablets or liquid products. Similar projects have already appeared: for example, Amazon had a quick order button for laundry gels on washing machines. So far, the implementation of such solutions has been held back due to the limited ability to obtain real-time data on consumers and their habits. However, this gap is closing with the growing popularity of d2c (direct-to-customer) companies such as Grove Collaborative, One Dollar Shave Club and others.

## Ubiquitous refill

In 20 years, at least 20% of household chemicals and cosmetics will be sold through refill stations. Caring for the environment and climate sustainability will reach a new level. This will cease to be a hobby of individuals, but will become a requirement of reality. Refill stations will become a ubiquitous phenomenon and will be within walking distance. So far, this trend is just emerging in Russia: responsible consumption practices are used only by the advanced part of the population, and refill stations are represented only in some networks (Perekrestok and Vkusvill). The development of the refill direction requires manufacturers to make significant changes in the product and production technologies. For example, when bottling, there are additional risks of contamination of the formulations and the penetration of bacteria. But in the near future, manufacturers will solve these problems.

## Transition from self-employed household work to services

As for house cleaning, furniture cleaning and other similar tasks, the lion's share of them will go into the service format. Most people will give up doing their own homework and replace it with professional services, perhaps also by subscription. The latest adopters of home machine washing will have completely different practices: fully biodegradable detergents operating in the maximum water conservation mode, filters that exclude microplastics from entering the environment, “targeted” washing of contaminated clothing areas. The frequency of cleaning will be significantly reduced due to the fact that new materials will have long-term water-repellent and antibacterial properties and clothes will get dirty much less often, and antibacterial coatings will learn to get rid of odor and bacteria themselves.

There will be other interesting solutions. Closer and faster communication between consumers and producers will allow you to quickly create what the market will really need. And what it will be - we will soon see.
