Russian President Vladimir Putin supported the proposal to award the title of Hero of Russia to Lieutenant Baldan Tsydypov, who saved 150 servicemen during Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, follows from a transcript published on the Kremlin's website.

The proposal to award Tsydypov was put forward during a video meeting with the president by the head of Buryatia, Alexei Tsydenov. According to him, the lieutenant “during a surprise attack on the convoy deployed his armored personnel carrier, covered the convoy, accepted an unequal battle, knocked out enemy equipment and, as a result, saved 150 of his comrades.” Tsydypov was seriously injured, he will have several operations, the head of the region said. The Ministry of Defense presented the lieutenant to the title of Hero of Russia, and the head of Buryatia asked the president to support this idea.

“I support,” the head of state replied.

Tsydenov also reported to the President on the state of affairs in the republic, noting the progress in the construction of social facilities and infrastructure development. In response, Putin asked Tsydenov not to forget about the need to solve the problem of emergency housing, and also drew attention to the high unemployment rate in the region.

Russia has been conducting a special military operation in Ukraine since February 24. Putin called its goals the protection of the inhabitants of Donbass from “genocide by the Kyiv regime”, as well as the “denazification” and “demilitarization” of Ukraine. Kyiv, in response, severed diplomatic relations with Moscow, introduced martial law and announced a general mobilization.

According [to](http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68536) Tsydenov, "many of our guys from Buryatia" are taking part in the special operation in Ukraine, and the "absolute majority of the inhabitants" support the special operation.

In early March, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on awarding the title of Hero of Russia to a native of Dagestan, Nurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov, who died during a special operation in Ukraine. According to the president, he was seriously wounded, but continued to fight and blew up the opponents surrounding him and himself with a grenade. He also posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Russia to the commander of the Sparta battalion from the DPR, Vladimir Zhoga, who, according to the head of the republic, Denis Pushilin, was mortally wounded while covering civilians, as well as lieutenant of the National Guard Maxim Kontsov, who died during the destruction of the Ukrainian sabotage group.

In early May, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu presented the stars of Heroes of Russia to the navigator of the fighter aviation regiment, Major Viktor Dudin, and the deputy commander of the assault aviation regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Litvinov.
