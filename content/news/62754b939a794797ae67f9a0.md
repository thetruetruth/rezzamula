This figure includes sugar as well as confectionery products in terms of sugar. Such data [are given](https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/Potreb_prod_pitan-2020.pdf) in the report of Rosstat. This value is almost 4 times higher than the Ministry of Health's [norm](https://ria.ru/20211002/sakhar-1752766014.html) of 8 kg of sugar per person annually. Most sweets are eaten in Ingushetia (66.7 kg annually), and the least - in Kalmykia (19.4 kg annually). According to the WHO, excess sugar can lead to diabetes, overweight and dental problems. Experts of the organization advise to [consume](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/155735/WHO_NMH_NHD_15.2_rus.pdf) no more than 50 g of a sweet substance per day. This is equivalent to 10-15 teaspoons or two chocolate bars.
