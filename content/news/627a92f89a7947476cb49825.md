## What's happening

- Dutch artist Thijs Biersteker [created](https://www.dezeen.com/2022/05/04/mb-co2-installation-thijs-biersteker/) the MB>CO2 apparatus, which shows how much CO2 emissions a person produces during the day while using the Internet .
- The MB>CO2 setup consists of three monitors that display different activities on the Internet: online calls, listening to music, mailing, NFT trading, etc. The monitors are connected to a computer that, using a special algorithm, calculates how many emissions a user made per day using the Internet. It then emits a calculated amount of carbon dioxide into a spherical terrarium with plants that wilt as the CO 2 concentration increases . Thus, the device is a visual metaphor for the impact of Internet use on the planet.
- Recycled steel, screens and a low-power computer were used to create the device.
- The apparatus only works for half an hour once a month, because the excess carbon dioxide destroys the plants and leads to a sharp release of CO 2 into the atmosphere when the terrarium is opened.
- Efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of Internet use are not enough, Bierstecker said, because it's hard for people to visualize the effects of pollution.

## What does it mean

The carbon footprint of the Internet depends on the energy needed to power the network, laptops and phones, as well as data centers and servers. According to the International Energy Agency, they [account for](https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks) about 2% of global electricity consumption, which is comparable to the entire aviation industry. By 2040, data centers are expected to account ]for 14%](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/digital-carbon-footprint-how-to-lower-electronics/) of the world's total CO2 emissions.

One way to reduce CO2 emissions from the IT industry is to build data centers in cold climates, because 40% of electricity [is](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317308758_Cooling_Energy_Consumption_Investigation_of_Data_Center_IT_Room_with_Vertical_Placed_Server) used to cool IT equipment. So, Google [built](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3431148/why-data-centres-are-the-new-frontier-in-the-fight-against-climate-change.html) a data center in Finland and began to consume less energy.
