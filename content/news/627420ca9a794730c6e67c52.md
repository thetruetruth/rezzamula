title: 'Scientists have figured out how the “computer” created 2000 years ago worked'
description: At the beginning of the 20th century, a mechanism created two thousand years ago was found in Greece. The clock-like artifact could predict the position of the stars and the dates of eclipses. In the spring of 2022, scientists determined the day on which it was calibrated.

In 1901, divers looking for sea sponges near the island of Antikythera in Greece [discovered a](https://www.antikythera-mechanism.com/history-of-the-antikythera-mechanism.html) sunken ancient Roman ship. In it they found three flat, deformed bronze pieces covered with growths. The artifact was named Antikythera after the place of discovery.

A year after the find was on the surface, the Greek archaeologist Valerios Stais [noticed](https://www.antikythera-mechanism.com/news-on-the-antikythera-mechanism.html) a gear hidden by corrosion with neat triangular teeth built into one of the plates, and a protractor-like graduation ring. For decades, scientists have tried to determine the purpose of this ancient mechanism.

The researchers found that the plates were [created](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-014-0145-5) about 2 thousand years ago. [In 2006, Mike Edmunds, a professor at Cardiff University in the UK, and his team were able to](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/worlds-first-computer-may-have-been-used-tell-fortunes-180959335/?no-ist) study the artifact in more detail using microfocus X-ray tomography . They determined that the object contained 37 gears (only 30 survived), around which were engraved. Scientists were able to read 95% of the inscriptions, about 2 thousand Greek characters.

The artifact turned out to be the likeness of a bronze clock. There were several small round dials with divisions and hands on the case. On the side was a handle for rewinding the mechanism forward or backward. And instead of hours and minutes , celestial bodies were [displayed on the plate: the Sun, the Moon and five planets known in antiquity (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn)](http://academy.edu.gr/index.php/en/antikythera_mechanism). Several dials showed calendars, while others showed the dates of eclipses of the Sun and Moon. After analyzing the structure and description of arrows, spirals and other details, scientists suggested that the purpose of the artifact was to calculate the movement of the planets and the dates of astronomical events, such as eclipses. The Antikythera Mechanism became known as the world's first analog computer.

The inscriptions on the movement also hinted at where it might have been made. Paul Iversen, a researcher at Case Western Reserve University in the United States , [noted](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/decoding-antikythera-mechanism-first-computer-180953979/) that the calendar named the months the same as in Corinth and its colonies in north western Greece. The dial reflected the dates of major events of that time, including the Olympic Games and the Galia festival in honor of the god Helios, which was traditionally celebrated on the island of Rhodes. According to the scientist, it was there that the mechanism could have been created. The workshop of the ancient Greek philosopher Posidonius [was located](https://iphras.ru/uplfile/root/biblio/pj/pj_6/4.pdf) on the island . Cicero, who listened to the lectures of the thinker and visited him, noted that in the first century BC, Posidonius made a model of the cosmos. There are also versions that the mechanism could be made by the [engineer](http://ancientrome.ru/antlitr/t.htm?a=1414870001) Archimedes [orastronomer](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/decoding-antikythera-mechanism-first-computer-180953979/) Hipparchus.

The process of studying the artifact reached a new level in 2021. Then a group of researchers from University College London, using the latest equipment, [created a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w) highly detailed working copy of the mechanism. So scientists confirmed the hypothesis that it made it possible to predict the position of celestial bodies, eclipses and other astrological events.

As the researchers [noted](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2315027-ancient-computer-may-have-had-its-clock-set-to-23-december-178-bc/), any mechanism needs to be calibrated for correct calculations. Scientists from University College London, who created a modern analogue of the object, managed to determine the “zero day” of the artifact in early 2022. They found out that the **mechanism was set up on December 23, 178 BC**. Then there was a visible solar eclipse, while the Sun moved into the constellation Capricorn. In addition, there was the winter solstice and the holiday of Isiah was celebrated.

According [to](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/decoding-antikythera-mechanism-first-computer-180953979/) Professor Mike Edmunds, who studied the artifact using X-ray tomography, the design of the mechanism shows that the ancient Greeks understood the laws of nature well. Even 2 thousand years ago they knew that everything around works according to certain rules, like a machine. This approach forms the basis of modern scientific views.
