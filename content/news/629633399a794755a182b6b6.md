Members of the European Union want to ban third countries from buying oil from Russia. This was [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sijg2Lk56I) by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki at a press conference after the EU summit in Brussels.

“Poland and more and more European Union countries are talking loudly about so-called secondary sanctions. Firstly, it is the possibility of imposing sanctions in such a way that Russian oil could not be sold to third countries, to countries outside the European Union, ”said Morawiecki (quoted by [RIA Novosti](http://ria.ru/)).

During the first day of the summit, EU member states agreed on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. The countries agreed to introduce a partial oil embargo, which will affect the supply of Russian oil by sea. The countries also agreed to disconnect Sberbank from SWIFT.

In addition, the topic of the restoration of Ukraine was touched upon at the summit. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , [said](/news/629559549a7947f76c1b33e8/) that European countries, together with Washington, intend to develop a path to attract investment to restore Ukraine, but noted that the process should be accompanied by reforms.
