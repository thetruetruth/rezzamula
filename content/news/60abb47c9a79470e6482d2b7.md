## What is financial literacy

This is a set of skills and knowledge that help you not to spend too much and increase your savings. These include budget planning, knowledge of credit and insurance products, the ability to manage money, pay bills correctly, invest and save.

Among the G20 countries, the population of Russia does not reach the average in terms of financial literacy. But to improve it, it is enough to master the theoretical basics and applied techniques. This will allow you not to worry about debts and unforeseen situations, to be calm about your long-term future and to live with dignity in the present.

*Financial literacy is like a school subject. You start with the basic principles and learn more and more useful tools over time.*

[Ramsey Solutions](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/financial-literacy/what-is-financial-literacy#authorbio), a financial consulting firm, has come up with three main approaches used by people who know how to handle money.

**Maintain a monthly budget.** To learn how to spend less than you receive, you should keep a budget. It is necessary to take into account income: salary, investments, tax deductions; fixed costs: rent, utility and loan payments; variable costs: food, shopping, travel and entertainment; saving.

**Form a "safety cushion".** It will save you in an emergency such as losing a job or a serious car breakdown. The minimum amount of reserves is income for 3-6 months, the optimal one is for 12 months. For example, with a salary of ₽50 thousand, the minimum airbag will be ₽150–300 thousand, and the optimal one is ₽600 thousand. If you have children, you need to increase the reserves.

**Invest in the future.** You can not take new loans until you have paid off the current ones, as well as spend loan money on entertainment and clothing. It is worth thinking about pension contributions and insurance, investing in training and buying only the equipment that is needed for work. For example, if you are a designer, a powerful computer will be a good purchase that will run complex 3D modeling programs and help you earn more.

## How to assess your financial literacy

To evaluate your money management skills, answer ten questions honestly. Give yourself one point for each “yes”. The more points, the higher financial literacy.

1. Do you keep a monthly budget that includes all major expenses and income?
1. Are you taking steps to reduce debt and credit obligations?
1. Do you know your credit score?
1. Do you understand how much money you spend on average living within 3-6 months?
1. Do you have a reserve fund that will allow you to survive sudden big troubles without borrowing money?
1. Do you know how compound interest works and what role it plays in the growth of invested funds?
1. Do you understand what types of insurance will help you secure your finances and investments?
1. Do you take advantage of tax deductions when possible?
1. Do you pay utility bills on time?
1. Do you understand the difference between investment and insurance?

## How to improve financial literacy

The correct attitude to money is the basis of the life philosophy of a financially literate person. To do this, you need to develop financial thinking and maintain discipline.

## Plan your budget

Get a spreadsheet in Excel, a notebook, or use special applications like Home Accounting. First, just write down all your expenses and segment them. Fixed expenses are rent, mortgages, loans, and utilities; variable expenses are everything else. These may include money for food, clothing, entertainment, recreation, household goods, and personal care. Also add up all your income.

After three months, analyze how much you have spent and received, and think about what you can give up in the future. These will be difficult decisions, but they will help cut costs. Plan your budget so that you set aside a certain amount of money. Be honest and realistic. Subtract savings and fixed expenses from income. All variable expenses will have to be included in the difference. You can use the convenient [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14dFvUPLa5HEOls-vpf9t4Z27WwYp4EnQgfHOEYGPuD8/copy) "T-W".

One of the working budget planning schemes is [the 50-30-20 rule](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp). If you follow it, 50% of the money should go to necessary fixed expenses, 30% to optional variables, and 20% to savings and investments.

## Make savings

Open a savings account and set up automatic replenishment from each paycheck. Determine the amount of deductions based on the planned budget. For starters, it can be an amount of several thousand rubles. Money in the bank will also grow due to interest. Experts advise storing them in multiple currencies.

For example, Associate Professor of the Department of Economic Theory of the PRUE. Plekhanova Tatyana Skryl [believes](https://regnum.ru/news/economy/3159338.html) that it is better to keep part of the funds in rubles, and part in dollars. And Andrey Maslov, an analyst at FINAM Group, advises betting on the euro and defensive currencies.

“Nevertheless, with regard to foreign exchange investments, the most conservative way to save money and gradually increase it will be investments in protective currencies such as the Swiss franc or the Japanese yen. The same euro felt noticeably better than the US dollar in 2020, and therefore it was much safer and more profitable to keep funds in this currency, ” [explains](https://regnum.ru/news/economy/3159828.html) Maslov.

A savings account is an additional savings for retirement and a reserve for serious needs, such as unplanned medical expenses and unforeseen circumstances. Do not withdraw money for purchases for the sake of pleasure, but try to replenish what you have spent as quickly as possible.

## Change the way you shop

The mindset is such that sometimes it’s hard for us to refrain from impulsive purchases, even with a well-planned budget. This is influenced by advertising, marketing, environment, environment and internal state when we make decisions. But there are a few tricks that will help you not fall for the tricks of brands and your own brain.

**Pause** if you don't understand if you really need the thing you like. Postpone the purchase for at least 24 hours, and preferably a few days. After this time, it will be easier to figure out whether it is worth spending money.

Use the **stranger quiz** to determine the value of a purchase for yourself. Imagine that you are offered to get what you want for free, or the equivalent amount of money. If you chose the second, you don't need a thing.

**Don't encourage shopping**. Find other sources of pleasure. Instead of walking around the mall, it is better to go to a park or a museum, go in for sports, take a bath, reread your favorite book or watch an interesting movie.

## Be careful with loans

Take out loans only when absolutely necessary or for things you really need, which will be a good investment. These may be the purchase of housing or funds for work and production, as well as paying for medical treatment. Do not combine several loans and take a new one only when you pay off the previous one.

If you're going to get a credit card, you'll need to figure out how to get the most out of it. Compare the offers of banks, study the restrictions, systems of fines and rewards. Be careful - do not spend more money than you can return during the interest-free period, do not go beyond the limits and do not overdue. You need to identify situations when and how you use a credit card, and follow this plan responsibly.

The best conditions in banks are received by people with a good personal credit rating (PCR). This is an assessment of solvency and reliability based on credit history. According to the NBKI scale, it can lie in the range from 300 to 850 points. Applications of borrowers with RCC 800-850 are [approved](https://realty.rbc.ru/news/5f119dd89a79475cf01e5361) in 71% of cases, and up to 600 - only in 24%.
