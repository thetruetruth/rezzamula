In Belarus, a specialized center that provides non-cash payments using bank payment cards has failed.

“JSC Bank Processing Center informs about the problem associated with the partial inoperability of the software and hardware complex,” the company said in a [statement](https://www.npc.by/about/news/o-chastichnoy-nerabotosposobnosti-programmno-tekhnicheskogo-kompleksa-31-05-2022/).

They also said that they are making efforts to restore the system "as soon as possible."

The fact that there are difficulties with paying for metro fares with bank cards was previously [reported](https://t.me/minskoemetro/800) by the Minsk Metro in Telegram. The subway attributed this to "technical problems in the banking system."

The Zerkalo portal [reports](https://news.zerkalo.io/economics/15246.html) with reference to readers that problems arose not only with paying for metro fares, but also when trying to use cards to pay for other services from cardholders of Belarusbank, Alfa-Bank, BelVEB, Belinvestbank, Belgazprombank, Belagroprombank and Sberbank.

The banking processing center [ensures](https://www.npc.by/about/) the operation of cards of the Belkart system, international systems VISA International, MasterCard WorldWide, UnionPay, American Express, as well as cards of the Mir payment system operating in Belarus, and also services ATMs and terminals at points of sale. Operations are successful only in the devices of those banks that issued the used card and use their own processing.

In total, the company services more than 9.6 million cards, 76.6 thousand trade and service organizations, 125 thousand payment terminals, 2.5 thousand ATMs and about 2 thousand information kiosks are connected to the system of the Bank's processing center, BelTA [indicates](https://www.belta.by/economics/view/v-belarusi-proizoshel-sboj-v-rabote-bankovskih-kart-505007-2022/).
